some possible relationships between these variables could include:

A higher 降雨機率 (probability of precipitation) may be associated with higher 體感溫度 (feels-like temperature) due to the cooling effect of precipitation.
A higher 體感溫度 may be associated with a higher 溫度 (temperature) due to the heat-trapping effect of humidity.
A higher 體感溫度 and 溫度 may be associated with a higher 相對濕度 (relative humidity) because warmer air can hold more water vapor.
A higher 相對濕度 may be associated with a lower 露點溫度 (dew point temperature) because the air is less able to hold moisture at a higher temperature.
Stronger 風速 (wind speed) may be associated with lower 體感溫度 because wind can cool the air.
The direction of 風向 (wind direction) may affect the temperature and precipitation in a given location. For example, a northerly wind may bring cold air and snow, while a southerly wind may bring warm air and rain.
